## Percussion Parts Assignment

This project is a Java program designed to help assign percussion parts in a band or ensemble based on instrument requirements and player skill sets.

In percussion music, a single song contains multiple pages (e.g. Percussion 1, Percussion 2, Timpani, Mallets). Each page may require one or more instruments simultaneously, meaning not every page can be covered by a single player. Additionally, different players have different skillsets and more experience, and different parts can require different skills.

This program models that system and works toward calculating the best fit between players and parts.

### Features
- Models songs, pages, instruments, and people with OOP.
- Supports multiple of each
- Establishes ownership of parts.
